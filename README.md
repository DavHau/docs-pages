# Docs

This repo builds the documentation for developer.holochain.org. 

## Requirements / Setup

- Python3
- Pip
- MkDocs: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/
- Install the rest of the requiements. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Local Development

To buld the docs run: 
`./create_docs.sh`

If you want to see the results locally you need a web server. We will probably set up project tooling for this soon.

In the mean-time Live Server works pretty well https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer.
