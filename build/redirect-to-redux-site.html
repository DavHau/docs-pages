    <h1>Redirecting to legacy Holochain Redux developer docs...</h1>
    <p>The page <code>/<script>document.write(expected_path)</script></code> may have existed on this site once upon a time, but it no longer does. We're guessing you're trying to access a resource meant for the previous version of Holochain, called Holochain Redux.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to visit this URL on the Holochain Redux site, click the link below. Or you can wait for five seconds and be redirected automatically!</p>
