# What is Holochain?

Holochain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) framework for data sharing, storage, and validation. 

Itâ€™s a Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) implementation of the P2P framework written in Rust and WebAssembly (WASM).

Holochain is part of a much larger vision for distributed computing, enabling quantum leaps in our collective intelligence and providing the ability for groups to organize themselves on all scales.
