# What is Holochain?

Holochain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) framework for data sharing, storage, and validation. 
 
Itâ€™s a Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) implementation of the P2Pframework written in Rust and WebAssembly (WASM).
 
Holochain is part of a much larger vision for distributed computing, enabling quantum leaps in our collective intelligence and providing the ability for groups to organize themselves on all scales. For more information, read about the [Ceptr project](http://ceptr.org/).
