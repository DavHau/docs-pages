			<p>Holochain supports <strong>fast and agile</strong> development by creating microservices that can be bridged together.</p>

			<p>On Holochain, capacity <strong>scales linearly</strong> with new Holochain users as each node contributes useful computing power.</p>

			<p>Users can continue working while offline or partitioned.</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>You’re not burdened with getting the code or application logic absolutely perfect before launch.</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Developers build 90–
95% of their application UI in the language of their choice, and the other ±10% on Rust/WASM.</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Governance, resilience, and privacy are  configurable to the requirements of the application, rather than a one-size-fits-all model.</p>
