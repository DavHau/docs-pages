# Ready to Develop with Holochain?

You can build almost any blockchain solution on Holochain and those solutions can talk to each other. Very little should be done in Holochain with respect to design. You can and should use your favorite language/framework for 90–95% of your application. 

Holochain has a "fat" UI but a skinny back end.

### Why Use Holochain?

* You want to reduce infrastructure spending and are worried about being crippled by the cost of your own success.
* You want to empower your user communities to own their infrastructure without having to become system admins.
* Your users want to own their data and have control over who accesses it.
* Your application needs to work with unreliable network conditions and even total loss of connectivity.
* You want rock-solid security—immune to massive data breaches and resilient to coordinated attacks.
* You consider data storage a liability and don’t want to be legally responsible for holding others’ data.
* You’ve heard about blockchain and like the idea of decentralization, but want your application to feel fast and don’t like the idea of paying a new piper.
* You’re exploring more equitable, fair models of revenue generation and want technology that both respects your values and makes it affordable to embody them.
* You want the users of your application to be empowered, cooperating participants in the online spaces that they inhabit. You’re not afraid to give up control if it means giving people the power to govern their own lives.
