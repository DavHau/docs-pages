::: coreconcepts-intro
Holochain allows agents to 'mutate' immutable data by publishing special **delete** and **update** actions to the DHT.

Immutable public data is a surprising feature of Holochain and many other distributed systems. It's important to understand the consequences in order to make informed design decisions that respect your users' privacy and storage space.

## Public, immutable databases

Data in a Holochain app is immutable for a few reasons:

* Immutability of the source chain and DHT data means we can safely assume that data wasn't changed after being published.
* Immutability makes data syncing faster, simpler, and more reliable. Mutable distributed databases often require complex coordination protocols that reduce performance.

However, developers expect CRUD (create, read, update, delete) to be a basic feature of a database; it's an important part of most apps. So how do we do it on Holochain?

## Simulating mutability

You might remember from [a few pages back](../3_source_chain/) that we described each record as an 'action', not a thing. When you create, update, or delete a piece of data, you're actually recording the _act of doing it_. (This is called [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), if you're interested.)

Here are all the mutation actions an agent can perform:

* A **new-entry action** calls an app or system entry into existence.
    * **Create** creates a new entry.
    * **Update** also creates a new entry, but marks an existing new-entry action as having an update.
* **Delete** marks an existing new-entry action as dead.
* **Create link** creates a new link.
* **Delete link** marks an existing create-link action as dead.
* **Withdraw action** (not yet implemented) marks an existing action as dead, allowing an author to reverse a mistakenly published action.
* **Purge entry** (not yet implemented) directs a DHT authority to erase an entry from their store, which is useful for removing immoral or illegal content or honoring right-to-be-forgotten requests.

In almost every case where an action 'modifies' old data, it's simply sending a piece of metadata to be attached to the old data. The old data still exists; it just has a different status. The only exception is 'purge entry', which permits a DHT authority to truly delete the data.

All the DHT does is accumulate all these actions and present them to the application. This gives you some versatility in deciding how to manage conflicting contributions from many agents.

It's also important to note that an update or delete action doesn't operate on entries or links --- it operates on _the actions that called them into existence_. That means you have to specify an action hash, not just an entry hash. In the case of deletes, an entry or link isn't dead until all the actions that created it are also dead. (Again, 'purge entry' is the only exception; it operates directly on entries.)

This prevents clashes between attempts to delete identical entries written by different authors at different times, such as Alice and Bob both writing the message "hello". That entry exists in one place in the DHT, but it will have two new-entry actions attached to it, each of which can be updated or deleted independently. If an entry and an action are considered one unit of data, there are really two pieces of data at that address --- one for each entry/action pair.

### Resolving conflicts in a conflict-free database

You may be thinking, if an entry can accumulate multiple update and delete actions, which is the _right_ one? The answer is that it's up to your application to decide. You may want to preserve all revisions and show them as a tree, allowing people to follow whichever path they prefer. You may want to write a simple conflict-resolution mechanism into your getter functions, such as "the earliest one wins" or "deletes always override updates". Or you may want to incorporate automatic merge functions that apply all updates to the thing being updated, such as a [conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT_](https://crdt.tech/).

You'll also want to decide whether the primary units of data in your DHT are _entries_ or _actions_ (that is, entry plus author plus timestamp). There are appropriate places to use each, but that's beyond the reach of this introduction.

In the future, Holochain may allow the developer to define CRDT-like automatic conflict-resolution strategies that collapse multiple CRUD actions into a consistent, canonical view of a piece of DHT data.

## Handling privacy concerns and storage constraints

You've seen how deletes and updates don't actually remove data; they just add a piece of metadata that changes its status. Even the future withdraw and purge actions will merely be polite requests to remove data. This can go against users' expectations. When you ask a central service to delete information you'd rather people not know, you're trusting the service to wipe it out completely --- or at least stop displaying it. When your data is shared publicly, however, you can't control what other people do with it.

In a sense, this is true of anything you put on the internet. Even when a central database permanently deletes information, it can live on in caches, backups, screenshots, public archives, reading-list apps, and people's memories. Privacy is all about creating friction against data sharing, so your responsibility as a designer is to create appropriate levels of friction. Here are some guidelines:

* Be careful about what the DNA returns to the UI. Your coordinator zome functions serve as the API to the DHT's data and can filter out old data. This doesn't completely prevent people from accessing it, because they can create their own coordinator zomes, but it does force them to put in some effort to get what they want.
* Design your UI to communicate the permanence of the information users publish so they can make responsible decisions about what they choose to share.

Additionally, because data takes up space even when it's no longer live, be judicious about what you commit to the source chain and the DHT.

* For large objects that have a short life, consider storing data outside of the DHT in separate, short-lived DHTs, [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [Dat](https://dat.foundation), a data store on the user's machine outside of Holochain, or even a centralized service.
* If an entry might have many small updates to it in a short time, queue them up and write them in one action. Or ignore the built-in update feature and commit updates as diffs instead.
* For large entries with frequent but small changes, break the content into 'chunks' that align with natural content boundaries such as paragraphs in text, regions in images, or scenes in videos.

## Key takeaways

* All data in the source chain and DHT is immutable once it's written. Nothing is ever deleted.
* It's useful to be able to modify data, so Holochain offers delete and update actions that simulate mutability by adding status-changing metadata to existing data.
* Because this may surprise users, developers have a responsibility to inform them of the permanence of data and protect them from negative consequences.
* In the future we intend to introduce actions that request the actual deletion of data, as well as automated conflict-resolution features.
