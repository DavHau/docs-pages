title: Build on Holochain
---

Now that you've learned Holochain's [core concepts](/concepts/1_the_basics), [installed Holochain](/get-started/#2-installing-holochain-development-environment), and [built a basic hApp](/get-started/3-forum-app-tutorial/), it's time to deepen your Holochain knowledge to the point where you feel capable of using its full feature set to build complex applications.

The [Build Guide](/build/guide/) expands on the Core Concepts guide with code examples and a deeper level of detail on how to use various APIs and what they're doing in the background. Each page in this guide brings together all the functions and concepts you need in order to get a particular thing done.
