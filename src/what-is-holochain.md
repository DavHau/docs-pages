# What is Holochain?

Technically speaking, Holochain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) framework for data sharing, storage, and validation. It’s a [Free/Libre and Open Source Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) (FLOSS) implementation of the P2P framework written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM).

Trent Lapinski, VP of Solutions at Stratus5, in his Hackernoon article [WTF is Holochain](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-holochain-35f9dd8e5908) describes Holochain as follows:

> “Holochain is an energy efficient, post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus systems between users. The key advantage of Holochain is that every device on the network gets its own secure ledger, or Holochain, and can function independently while also interacting with all the other devices on the network for a truly decentralized edge computing solution.”

Holochain is NOT a public protocol platform where you have to choose between multiple, hard-to-scale networks with their own tradeoffs. It’s also NOT a private network where a solutions’ growth and evolution are stunted by adapting to ever-changing needs.

Holochain is an application framework for building distributed solutions. It allows you to build dApp products to fit user requirements without dealing with network constraints. This means every user controls their own data and avoids the risk of their data being sold or exposed to third parties.

We consider Holochain to be the Linux of distributed apps. It has powerful features and is uniquely organized. For example,

* Holochain is 100% free and has an open-source framework.
* Holochain is customizable, developer friendly, and offers opportunities for growth.
* Holochain promotes easy onboarding.
* Holochain supports a large commercial ecosystem.

With Holochain, you can build better public network dApps, private and permissioned networks or dApps, and distributed apps that bridge the public-private model with multiple layers of permissions and governance. All of this is natively achieved using a consistent framework.
