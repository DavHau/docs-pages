# Who is Holochain For?

### Holochain is a smart choice if:

* Your users need to access your application despite unreliable network conditions or even total loss of connectivity.
* You want to reduce your security burden by taking advantage of proactive, adaptive security that minimizes the impact of data breaches and automatically responds to attacks.
* You want to see your application scale automatically and cheaply with user adoption.
* You need to meet strong privacy requirements (e.g., [GDPR](https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/beyond-gdpr-holo-vault-delivering-on-self-sovereign-identity-for-distributed-applications-543a5449d5c9) and [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Privacy_Rule)) without much hassle.
* Your users demand customizability and sovereignty over their online activities.
* You want to equip your user communities to own their infrastructure—without having to become system admins.
* You’re exploring non-extractive business models, but you think that 'being nice' doesn't bring in as much money and you want technology that makes it affordable to stick to your principles.
* You’re ready to trade some control for technology that puts your users first.
* You’ve tried blockchain, but found it slow, expensive, and hard to tweak for your needs.
