# Welcome, bluesky fans!

<div class="coreconcepts-intro" markdown=1>
Holochain is a development framework for building peer-to-peer applications. We take a different approach from traditional cloud and blockchain, starting with the agency of individual users and working outward. Holochain applications are secure, scalable, private, and offline-friendly. We invite you to try Holochain out and report your experience back to the bluesky working group.

## Users

If you want to see what a Holochain application feels like to use, here are some that you can try:

* [Register](https://register.holo.host/elemental) to be an alpha tester for [Elemental Chat](https://elemental-chat.holo.host/), a proof-of-concept chat application built with Holochain and hosted on the [Holo network](https://holo.host) (Note: There is a wait list.)
* If you are on Linux or Mac, download [Acorn](https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases/tag/v0.5.1-alpha), a collaborative planning app. If you want to join a public workspace, try the project invitation secret `residual improvise landfall bogus degraded`. (Warning: it's an unmoderated space, so don't be surprised if you see weird stuff there.)
* If you are on Linux or Mac, download the latest [Holochain Launcher and Elemental Chess](https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/) and play against a friend. (Launcher is still pre-alpha, so you may encounter some bugs.)
* If you are on Windows (or Mac or Linux) download [Snapmail](https://github.com/glassbeadsoftware/snapmail-release/releases/tag/v0.0.5), a local first mail client for intranet messaging.
