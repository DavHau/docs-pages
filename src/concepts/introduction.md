# Holochain Core Concepts

Welcome to the Core Concepts introduction! In the next few pages, we're going to introduce you to the basics of Holochain, a framework and network protocol for building secure distributed applications. Holochain is different from what you may be used to, but don't worry---we'll go at a comfortable pace, building on things you already know.

## Who is this introduction for?

We've written this introduction for programmers, CTOs, and other technically-oriented people. It's a bit like a choose-your-own-adventure story:

* **If you're in a hurry** and need to find out if Holochain is a good fit for your project, you can just read the articles---or even just the intro paragraph at the top of each article.
* **If you're a programmer** and want to see the concepts come to life, follow the tutorials. Each tutorial is quick---you'll be creating a running app in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Code samples are written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
* **If you want to dig deep**, each article has links to further reading from the guidebook, API documentation, or web.
